- A `slug` is a short label that contains only letters,
numbers, underscores, or hyphens.

- `BigAutoField` is `64-bit` integer that automatically increments according to available IDs.

- `timezone.now` returns current datetime in a timezone-aware format.

- To use database-generated default values, we use the `db_default` attribute instead of `default`.

- By using `auto_now_add`, the date will be saved automatically when creating an object.

- By using `auto_now`, the date will be updated automatically when saving an object.

- `Meta` class defines metadata for the model.
  
- `Index ordering` is not supported on `MySQL`. If you use
MySQL for the database, a descending index will be created
as a normal index

- We use `related_name` to specify the name of the reverse relationship, from `User` to `Post`. This will allow us to access related objects easily from a user object by using the `user.blog_posts` notation.

- The `sqlmigrate` command takes the migration names and returns their SQL without executing it.

- We can specify a custom database name for your model in the `Meta` class of the model using the `db_table` attribute.

Django creates an auto-incremental id column that is used as the primary
key for each model, but you can also override this by specifying `primary_key=True` on one of your model fields. The default `id` column
consists of an integer that is incremented automatically. This column
corresponds to the `id` field that is automatically added to your model.

- `facet counts` indicate the number of objects corresponding to each specific filter.

- The `Django ORM` is compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MariaDB.
- The Django ORM is based on `QuerySets`. A QuerySet is a collection of
database queries to retrieve objects from your database. You can apply filters to QuerySets to narrow down the query results based on given parameters.

- `get_or_create()` method facilitates this by either retrieving an object or creating it if not found.
- Django model has at least one manager, and the default manager is called `objects`. You get a QuerySet object using your model manager.
- To retrieve all objects from a table, we use the all() method on the default objects manager.
```py
all_posts = Post.objects.all()
```

- Django QuerySets are lazy, which means they are only evaluated when they are forced to.
- To filter a QuerySet, you can use the `filter()` method of the manager.
- Two underscores are used to define the lookup type, with the format
`field__lookup`.
- The `contains` lookup translates to a SQL lookup using the `LIKE` operator

Examples:
```py
Post.objects.filter(id__in=[1, 3])
Post.objects.filter(id__gt=3)
Post.objects.filter(id__gte=3)
Post.objects.filter(id__lt=3)
Post.objects.filter(id__lte=3)
Post.objects.filter(title__istartswith='who')
Post.objects.filter(title__iendswith='reinhardt?')
```

```py
from datetime import date
Post.objects.filter(publish__date=date(2024, 1, 31))
Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2024)
Post.objects.filter(publish__month=1)
Post.objects.filter(publish__day=1)
Post.objects.filter(publish__date__gt=date(2024, 1, 1))
Post.objects.filter(author__username='admin')
Post.objects.filter(author__username__starstwith='ad')
Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2024, author__username='admin')
```

```py
Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2024) \
     .filter(author__username='admin')
```

```py
Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2024) \
     .exclude(title__startswith='Why')
```

```py
Post.objects.order_by('title')
Post.objects.order_by('-title')
Post.objects.order_by('author', 'title')
Post.objects.order_by('?') #To order randomly
```

```py
Post.objects.all()[:5] #limit 5
Post.objects.all()[3:6] #offset 3 limit 6
Post.objects.order_by('?')[0]
```

```py
Post.objects.filter(id_lt=3).count()
Post.objects.filter(title__startswith='Why').exists()
```

```py
post = Post.objects.get(id=1)
post.delete()
```

- A `Q` object allows you to encapsulate a collection of field lookups. You can compose statements by combining Q objects with the & (and), | (or), and ^(xor) operators.
```py
from django.db.models import Q
starts_who = Q(title__istartswith='who')
starts_why = Q(title__istartswith='why')
Post.objects.filter(starts_who | starts_why)
```

- Creating a QuerySet doesnâ€™t involve any database activity until it is
evaluated. When a QuerySet is evaluated, it translates into a SQL query to the database.

QuerySets are only evaluated in the following cases:
- The first time you iterate over them
- When you slice them, for instance, Post.objects.all()[:3]
- When you pickle or cache them
- When you call repr() or len() on them
- When you explicitly call list() on them
- When you test them in a statement, such as bool(), or, and, or if
  

- URL patterns allow you to map URLs to views. A URL pattern is composed
of a string pattern, a view, and, optionally, a name that allows you to name the URL project-wide.

- `slug` (a string that can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens).
